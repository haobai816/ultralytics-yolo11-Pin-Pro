1. The requirement.txt file lists the Python dependencies for the project’s virtual environment.
2. Pin_datasets.yaml and Pin_low_quality_dataset.yaml are dataset configuration files; set the dataset paths to their actual locations.
3. train.py and val.py are the training and validation scripts for the model.
4. We provide the best-trained models for the PIN_DEFECT_DATASET and PLQD datasets—detailed in the Trained_model folder.

The PIN_DEFECT_DATASET, PLQD datasets, and the verified_dataset are available on Google Drive.
Here are the Google Drive links as follows:
